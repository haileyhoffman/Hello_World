# Hello_World

Hello World!

My name is Hailey Hoffman and I am a current first year Masters student at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Finance. I completed my Bachelor's at Drake University in Computer Science and hope to get a job in analytics after receiving both of my Master's degrees in May of 2023.

In my free time, I like to play with my cats, go on walks and do some photography, and play video games.
